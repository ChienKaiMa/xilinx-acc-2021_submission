# QUBO Formulation and Parameter Optimization

## Document

The document `DOC.ipynb` describes:

- How to formulate a QUBO problem to find the optimal arbitrage opportunity, and
- How to optimize the parameters, both in QUBO formulation and in the SB/SQA algorithms.

The file is in `.ipynb` format because GitHub supports LaTeX rendering for markdown in `.ipynb` files but not `.md` files.

## Implementation

The python implementation of QUBO formulation can be found at `src/python/qubo_gen.py`. The implementation of parameter optimization flow is yet to be provided.
